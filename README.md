This project is a full-stack college website designed to provide a centralized web platform for managing and displaying academic and administrative information. The backend is developed using Flask (2.2.5), which handles routing, server-side logic, and communication with the database. The frontend is built using HTML and CSS, focusing on a clean and responsive user interface.

MongoDB is used as the primary database for storing application data such as user information, content records, and form submissions. Database operations are performed using PyMongo (4.4.0), and MongoDB Compass is used for visual database management and monitoring during development.

The application also integrates Flask-Mail (0.9.1) to support email-based features such as contact form submissions and system notifications. Sensitive configuration details, including database credentials and email settings, are securely managed using environment variables with python-dotenv (1.0.0). Werkzeug (2.2.3) is used internally for request handling and security-related utilities.

Overall, this project demonstrates practical full-stack web development concepts, including backend–frontend integration, database connectivity, form handling, and secure configuration management. It is intended for academic use and serves as a foundational project showcasing structured backend development using Flask.
